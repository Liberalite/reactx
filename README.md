# reactX - what is it and why did you write that?
It is simplified version of react lib written in typescript Simplified means that it uses no shadow dom nor fiber but in case of any state change it rerenders whole DOM tree.

And why ? beacuse it `It is fun and easy to write your own React` and if one uses `typescrpipt` it is even more fun.
Take a look at the tests and checkout 

# install
go for `npm install` then run `webpack && webpack-dev-server` you can check demo app running on `http://localhost:8080/` it's reactx version of `Dan Abramov's Counter`, to test it just run `npm test`
